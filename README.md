Handwritten Digit Recognizer
•	Implemented a Python-based digit recognition model using the MNIST dataset
•	Preprocessed images (normalization, reshaping) for training
•	Trained and tested the model to classify digits (0–9) from handwritten images
•	Evaluated performance using accuracy score on test data
Speech Recognition System
•	Built a Python-based speech-to-text system using DeepSpeech and RNN models, achieving 85% accuracy on noisy datasets
•	Processed audio with Librosa and MFCC extraction; integrated Transformers for sentiment analysis
•	Optimized performance for diverse accents and background noise
